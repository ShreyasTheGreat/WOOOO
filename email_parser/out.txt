Here's something I've been thinking about... What would it take to create
an "education engine" that would deliver the ideal content at the right

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me yesterday. I found your
advise to be very helpful and I'm really glad you told me about SCORE and
the demand for data science in high tech manufacturing. It was also
tremendously helpful that you introduced me to Christina as a way to help
test out the hexibox.

 I'll be in touch when I have a bit of a more solid business model or two.

New Message: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm working on a project right now to visualize see-click-fix data, and in
particular, I'm want to look at the issues in New Haven that have been both
acknowledged and closed.

I got the dataset yesterday using the seeclickfix API, by querying the
request types for the New Haven request ids. There are 11,694 issues in the
dataset that I downloaded, of which:

5169 have a status of acknowledged,
121 have a status of closed,
6404 have a status of open.

In order to determine weather an issue was closed or acknowledged, I looked
at weather or not a timestamp was provided for the closed_at or
acknowledged_at variables.

The number of issues in my dataset that have a timestamp for both
acknowledged_at and closed_at is 282, which Ben tells me is quite a bit
lower than it should be.

Please let me know if there is a better way of obtaining information about
weather an issue has been acknowledged or closed and the respective times.
Thank You,
-Allan

So I guess the challenge would be to get the conductivity low enough that
the excess resistance associated with connecting to the strip would be
negligible.
Interesting thought with the saltwater, I might give that a try.

New Message: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi Richard,

    So hexibox is one of my ideas that came out of a need that I had to
make a more modular and low maintnance storage system. I've spent several
months building a prototype out of cardboard, opened up a general business
for all of my operations, received a provisional patent for the design, and
recieved quotes and samples from a manufacturer. The website I put up is
here:
     http://thehexibox.com <http://thehexibox.com>
     I have a few other ideas I'm exploring, but hexibox is the most
developed one.
     I'm free to meet next week around noon on Tuesday, Thursday and
Friday. Let me know if any of these work. I look forward to hearing from
you.

New Message: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi Johnathan,

Thanks for getting back to me.

So I basically need the resistance from one end to the other of each strip
to be somewhere within the range of 10 to 100k ohm. I'm putting a sliding
voltage divider accross the strip, and I need the resistance to be low
enough that I get a stable voltage, and high enough that the circuit isn't
sensitive to perturbances. The surface should be somewhere between 3x4",
and 1x2'.

As for the width of the strips, there's no reason not to have them very
small, the only concern is that they are not easy to break (I'm going to be
sliding over the surface).

As for the material, I honestly don't know where to start, if you have any
good recommendations for where to find materials and their proerties, let
me know.

I need to make some time to do the calculations and find the range of
conductivity or resistivity that would work, but I'll get back to you once
I have that.

thanks,
-Allan

My name is Allan, we had met at makehaven a few months ago, and exchanged
emails (we talked about motorized roller blades).

I had lost the notebook with your email (to my embarrassment), but recently
found it, so I wanted to get in touch.

Are you free at all to meet up over lunch in the next week or two?

New Message: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi Shantel,

So sorry for the delay! I somehow missed this email the first time around.

So I met with an industrial designer to discuss the basic marketing
strategy, and I made a website (which I need to update) since the last time
we met.

I had put off my business activities indefinitely towards the end of April
to finish some work that I was doing for a certification program, which I'm
just about wrapping up now.

I'll make sure to keep you in the loop about any updates from now on.

-Allan

New Message: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi Elise,

So for my project, I need to have several parallel flat and conductive
strips on a flat, exposed surface, with a particular conductivity (this
would depend on the design, but the important thing is that I can select
the conductivity that I need). The ideal solution would be to order a
custom pcb (where the conductive material has a particular resistance), but
I could also use any sort of metal strips or conductive tape for the
initial prototype. Either way, I don't really know where to look, and
haven't been able to find anything like this, so any help I could get in
finding something that works would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
-Allan

New Message: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    My plan is to do a bit more exploratory analysis and work on a better
strategy for classification and/or tagging of the issues.
    Once I get a better grasp of the data, I'm going to include a wider
array of categories and charts.
     I want to do one or more animations or guided visualizations as well,
once I have a better grasp of the data. This would be either a general
overview, like types of issues by month, or something specific, like the
timing and location of trees removed or trimmed by UI.
     Eventually, I also want to include a feature that allows you to get
metadata by clicking on the individual issues. I'd need to look into it,
but it may also be possible to integrate a maps API to get more detailed
geographic information on a particular set of issues.

Something just came up, and I can't make it to hackcon :( . Would it be
possible to refund the ticket at least partially?
Thanks,
